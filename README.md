# Cat_seeking_excel_game
This is a work in progress of a battleship-like game using Excel VBA. This project was started to help me learn more about Excel VBA and other macros inside Excel. 
If you found bugs, well, enjoy it to the fullest hehe. Hope you enjoy this 1 min long game. Thank you

Before playing:
1. Enable macro in Microsoft Excel
2. The excel has been tested using Excel 2016 and newer, older version may not compatible

How to play:
1. press Reset Button
2. Press Player's Ship Formation Button
3. You can repeat step 2 until you have a good battlecats formation. The formation can be seen on the player's field shown by cells that contain number.
4. Press Start Button
5. You will start first. To start and play, double click the Enemy's field which you think would contain a battlecat. 
6. The steps and winner of the game will be announced in the announcement field. 
7. The winner is the one who reach total score of 17 first. 
8. If you want to play again, repeat step 1 to 4. 
9. Enjoy


Next update (?):
We will see, maybe yes, maybe not
1. Smarter and Easier CPU difficulty
2. Manual users input for placing battlecats
3. More battlecats shapes
